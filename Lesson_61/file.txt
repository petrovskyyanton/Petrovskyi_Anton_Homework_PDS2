# PyMod Installer Bundle #
##########################

The PyMod Installer Bundle is distributed in order to facilate the installation of PyMod and its
components through its scripts. These scripts run inside PyMOL by using the 'Run->...' command on
PyMOL external GUI window. Requires PyMOL version >= 0.99. Incentive and open source PyMOL builds
are supported. Functional on 32/64bit PyMOL, on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

# install_all.py script #
#########################

This install_all.py script can be used to unpack on your system (and to automatically configure them
for use within PyMod) the following components:

    - NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/) and Biopython (http://biopython.org/) libraries.
    - the executables of these bioinformatics tools:
          - ClustalW (http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/)
            Clustal Omega (http://www.clustal.org/omega/)
            MUSCLE (http://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm)
            PSI-BLAST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)
            PSIPRED (http://bioinfadmin.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/psipred/)
            ksdssp (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/software.html#ksdssp)
    - the 'swissprot' and 'pdbaa' BLAST sequence databases (from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/)

The install_all.py script can be run in these two situations:

    1) Before installing PyMod, in order to install PyMod on your system along with its
       dependencies, external tools and data files. The install_all.py script will:
           - install PyMod in one of PyMOL plugins directories. Note that if you have more than one
             PyMOL plugin directory, the installer will place PyMod files in the first plugin
             directory with writing privileges it finds. In this way you will not be able to control
             PyMod installation path.
           - build a '.pymod' directory on your home folder and store its external tools
             and data files in it. Once you start up PyMod inside PyMOL for the first time, PyMod
             will move these files to its main folder (the 'PyMod directory' specified when running
             PyMod for the first time) and automatically update its configuration file, so that the
             external tools and data files unpacked by the installer can be used within the plugin.
           - place in PyMOL Python libraries directory (usually the one containing the pmg_tk
             directory) NumPy or Biopython, whenever these two packages are missing on your PyMOL.

    2) Recommended: after having manually installed PyMod (for example by using PyMOL 'Plugin
       Manager'), in order to install its missing dependencies, external tools and data files. The
       install_all.py script will:
           - unpack its external tools and data files in the '.pymod' directory in your
             home folder and it will move these files to in the 'PyMod directory' and automatically
             configure the PyMod configuration file. In this way, the next time you start PyMod,
             the new components can readily be used by the plugin.
           - install on your system the missing Python libraries just as in situation (1).
       This mode is recommended, because by manually installing PyMod, you can decide its
       installation directory.

# get_information.py #
######################

This is an additional script shipped in the PyMod Installer Bundle which will not install anything
on your system, but it will provide you with information about your PyMOL build (version,
architecture, etc...) and the installation status of PyMod 2 and its components.

The script will print a series of information in the output region of the PyMOL main window. You can
scroll the output using the window scrollbar. Among the useful information which you might find,
there is the architecture of your PyMOL build (listed in the 'PyMOL information' section of the
output) and the installation status of the PyMod 2 components on your system (listed in the
'Checking components installation state' section of the output).
